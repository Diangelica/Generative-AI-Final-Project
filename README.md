# Generative AI Final Project

### Grammy Awards Data Science Project
###### This project explores trends in the Grammy Awards from 1958 to 2024 using data-driven analysis and predictive modeling. The goal was to analyze award nomination patterns and build regression models to predict the number of wins an artist might receive based on their nominations and other engineered features.

### Dataset
###### The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and includes all Grammy Award nominees and winners from 1958â€“2024. Each record includes the award name, nominee, work title, year, and whether the nominee won.
