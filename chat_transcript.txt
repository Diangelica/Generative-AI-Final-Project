User: Write a python code that performs the following tasks:
1. Identify the columns of a data frame with missing values.
2. Replace the missing values thus identified with mean value of the column.
3. Deletes the duplicate entries from the data frame.

Assistant: (Provides code with explanation using pandas)

User: Write a python code that identifies the top 5 attributes with highest correlation with the target attribute in a data frame.

Assistant: (Provides code using .corr(), .abs(), and .sort_values())

User: Write a python code that counts the number of entries in a dataframe with each unique value of a specific attribute.

Assistant: (Provides code using value_counts())

User: Write a python code that creates a Seaborn box plot between a source and target attributes of a dataframe.

Assistant: (Provides code using seaborn.boxplot)

User: Write a python code that creates a regression plot between a source attribute and a target attribute.

Assistant: (Provides code using seaborn.regplot)

User: Write a python code to fit a linear regression model on a target variable on basis of a source variable. Calculate the R^2 values and MSE values for this model.

Assistant: (Provides code using sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression)

User: Write a python code to fit a linear regression model on a target variable on basis of a set of source variables. Calculate the R^2 values and MSE values for this model.

Assistant: (Provides code using multiple features in sklearn)

User: Write a python code that can perform the following tasks.
1. Create a pipeline with standard scalar, second degree polynomial features and linear regression model.
2. Fit this pipeline for a target variable using a set of source attributes from a dataframe.
3. Evaluate the R^2 and MSE values for the trained model.

Assistant: (Provides code using sklearn.pipeline with StandardScaler, PolynomialFeatures, and LinearRegression)

User: Write a python code that can perform the following tasks.
1. Assuming that a subset of the attributes of a data frame are source attributes and one of the attributes is a target attribute, split the data into training and testing data assuming the testing data to be 20%.
2. Create and fit a Ridge regression model using the training data, setting the regularization parameter to 0.1.
3. Calculate the MSE and R^2 values for the Ridge Regression model using the testing data.

Assistant: (Provides code using Ridge, train_test_split, mean_squared_error, and r2_score)

User: Write a python code that can perform the following tasks.
1. Assuming that a subset of the attributes of a data frame are source attributes and one of the attributes is a target attribute, split the data into training and testing data assuming the testing data to be 20%.
2. Apply second degree polynomial scaling to the training and testing data.
3. Create and fit a Ridge regression model using the training data, setting the regularization parameter to 0.1.
4. Calculate the MSE and R^2 values for the Ridge Regression model using the testing data.
